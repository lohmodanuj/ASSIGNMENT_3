                        <p>Peafowl is a common name for two bird species in the genera Pavo and Afropavo within the</p>
                        <p>tribe Pavonini of the family Phasianidae (the pheasants and their allies). Male peafowl are</p>
                        <p>referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl are referred to as peahens, although peafowl of</p>
                        <p>either sex are often referred to colloquially as "peacocks".</p><br><br><br>
                        <p>The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally from the Indian</p>
                        <p>subcontinent, and the green peafowl from Southeast Asia; The Congo peafowl is not a true</p>
                        <p>peafowl, native only to the Congo Basin. Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls</p>
                        <p>and their extravagant plumage. The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species,</p>

                        <p>The functions of the elaborate iridescent colouration and large "train" of peacocks have been </p>
                        <p>the subject of extensive scientific debate. Charles Darwin suggested that they served to </p>
                        <p>attract females, and the showy features of the males had evolved by sexual selection. More</p>
                        <p>recently, Amotz Zahavi proposed in his handicap principle that these features acted as </p>
                        <p>honest signals of the males' fitness, since less-fit males would be disadvantaged by the </p>
                        <p>difficulty of surviving with such large and conspicuous structures.</p><br><br>

                        <hr>
                        <br>
                        <p>The Indian peacock (Pavo cristatus) has iridescent blue and green plumage, mostly metal-</p>
                        <p>like blue and green. In both species, females are a little smaller than males in terms of</p>
                        <p>weight and wingspan, but males are significantly longer due to the "tail", also known as a</p>
                        <p>"train".[2] The peacock train consists not of tail quill feathers, but highly elongated upper</p>
                        <p>tail coverts. These feathers are marked with eyespots, best seen when a peacock fans his tail.</p>
                        <p>All species have a crest atop the head. The Indian peahen has a mixture of dull grey, brown,</p>
                        <p>and green in her plumage. The female also displays her plumage to ward off female</p>
                        <p>competition or signal danger to her young.</p><br>
                        <p>Male green peafowl (Pavo muticus) have green and bronze or gold plumage, and black</p>
                        <p>wings with a sheen of blue. Unlike Indian peafowl, the green peahen is similar to the male</p>
                        <p>but has shorter upper tail coverts, a more coppery neck, and overall less iridescence. Both</p>
                        <p>males and females have spurs.[3]</p><br>

                        <p>The Congo peacock (Afropavo congensis) male does not display his covert feathers, but</p>
                        <p>uses his actual tail feathers during courtship displays. These feathers are much shorter than</p>
                        <p>those of the Indian and green species, and the ocelli are much less pronounced. Females of</p>
                        <p>the Indian and African species are dull grey and/or brown. Chicks of both sexes in all the</p>
                        <p>species are cryptically coloured. They vary between yellow and tawny, usually with patches</p>
                        <p>of darker brown or light tan and "dirty white" ivory. Mature peahens have been recorded as</p>
                        <p>suddenly growing typically male peacock plumage and making male calls.[4] Research has</p>
                        <p>suggested that changes in mature birds are due to a lack of estrogen from old or damaged</p>
                        <p>ovaries, and that male plumage and calls are the default unless hormonally suppressed.[5]</p><br><br>

                        <p>nanostructures of the barbules (fiber-like components) of the feathers, produce the peacock's</p>
                        <p>colours. 2D photonic-crystal structures within the layers of the barbules cause the</p>
                        <p>colouration of their feathers.[6] Slight changes to the spacing of the barbules result in</p>
                        <p>different colours. Brown feathers are a mixture of red and blue: one colour is created by the</p>
                        <p>periodic structure and the other is created by a Fabry–Pérot interference peak from</p>
                        <p>reflections from the outer and inner boundaries. Color derived from physical structure rather</p>
                        <p>than pigment can vary with viewing angle, causing iridescence.[7]</p><br>

                        <p>surface of the feather. Then, the male will turn and display his feathers about 45° to the right</p>
                        <p>of the sun's azimuth which allows the sunlight to accentuate the iridescence of his train. If</p>
